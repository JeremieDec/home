I define myself as a Business scientist. Of course this term doesn't exists. I can't really choose between Data science and business or market/people-awareness.  my goal is to apply business skills and sourced from market studies, customer behavior and use data to answer hypothesis. Out of computer vision, tabular (aka Structured data) is nowadays coming to an ever solving capability. I am not a stacker, a super technical guru who can optimize a score to the decile, percentile even the 'thousand-ile' and I have a lot of respect for the dedication and brain anabolism some people can put in order to bring complex data to form a beautiful puzzle of prediction. I find doing this also an healthy compromise because it involves different ways of thinking. In my Kaggle kernels (the work I post), I will try to use diverses concepts from business, social study to lead the 'Exploratory Data Analysis' and result in predictions at medium optimisation level.
